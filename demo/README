Ruote+AMQP Demo
===============

This demo represents a code build system progressing through
  develop->build->image->test

It runs a mix of local and RabbitMQ/AMQP connected participants.

Bootstrap
=========
Everything here is done as a normal user.

Ensure the Bundler gem is installed on the system (see ../INSTALL)

Ideally add /var/lib/gems/1.8/bin/ to PATH:
 PATH=$PATH:/var/lib/gems/1.8/bin/

Don't forget to make sure you've got a copy of the upstream gems we're
working on:
 cd ../ruote
 ./get-git.sh 
 cd ../demo

Bundle has had .bundle/config set to point to bundled_gems/ as the
project gem path and then:
 bundle install

At this point you can
 cd ..
 ./RUN_DEMO.sh

You'll get 4 xterm windows popping up representing each participant
and the engine. Once they're up run
 demo/START.sh
and watch the participants operate. Note that success/failure is rnd()
based.


Playing with the code.
======================

Having done that we can do things like:
 bundle exec daemon-kit new_participant   -i ruote

If you create a new participant the 
 */config/amqp.yml
and
 */config/ruote.yml
need to be setup.

The logic is found in lib/*.rb and needs to be registered via libexec/*.rb
