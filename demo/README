Making AMQP Participants

Debian/Ubuntu packages:
ruby1.8
ruby1.8-dev
rubygems1.8
ri1.8

Bootstrap
=========
Ensure the Bundler gem is installed on the system
 sudo gem install bundler

For Ubuntu you may need:
  https://edge.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-on-rails/+archive/ppa

Ideally add /var/lib/gems/1.8/bin/ to PATH:
 PATH=$PATH:/var/lib/gems/1.8/bin/

Don't forget to make sure you've got a copy of the upstream gems we're
working on:
 cd ../ruote
 ./get-git.sh 
 cd ../demo

Prepare .bundle/config to set the bundled_gems/ path and then:
 bundle install


Having done that we can do things like:
 bundle exec daemon-kit new_participant   -i ruote

Now the */config/amqp.yml needs to be set

defaults: &defaults
  user: ruote
  pass: ruote
  host: amqpvm
  vhost: ruote-test
