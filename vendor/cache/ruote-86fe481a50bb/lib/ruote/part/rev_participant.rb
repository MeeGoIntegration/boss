module Ruote

  #
  # This participant was born out of a suggestion from Jan TopiÅ„ski in
  # http://groups.google.com/group/openwferu-users/browse_thread/thread/be20a5d861556fd8
  #
  # This participant is a gateway to code placed in a directory.
  #
  #   engine.register do
  #     toto, Ruote::RevParticipant, :dir => 'participants/toto/'
  #   end
  #
  # Then in the participants/toto/ dir :
  #
  #     /my_workflow__0.1__toto_0.6.rb
  #       # participant toto, workflow 'my_workflow' with revision '0.1'
  #     /my_workflow__toto.rb
  #       # participant toto, workflow 'my_workflow' any revision
  #     /toto_0.6.rb
  #       # participant toto with rev '0.6', any workflow
  #     /toto.rb
  #       # participant toto, any rev, any workflow
  #       # ...
  #
  # The scheme goes like :
  #
  #    /wf-name__wf-revision__participant-name__p-revision.rb
  #
  # The files themselves look like :
  #
  #   def consume(workitem)
  #     workitem.fields['kilroy'] = 'was here'
  #     reply_to_engine(workitem)
  #   end
  #
  # The file directly contains the classical participant methods defined at the
  # top level. #cancel, #accept?, #on_reply and of course #consume are OK.
  #
  #
  # Maybe, look at the tests for more clues :
  #
  #   https://github.com/jmettraux/ruote/blob/master/test/functional/ft_57_rev_participant.rb
  #
  # *Note* : It's probably not the best participant in a distributed context, it
  # grabs the code to execute from a directory. If you use it in a distributed
  # context, you'll have to make sure to synchronize the directory to each host
  # running a worker.
  #
  # *Warning* : this participant trusts the code it deals with, there is no
  # security check.
